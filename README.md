# Numbers

This is a little group project for groups of 3:

1. **Study the Expected Output**: Use the web page as a group and study the
   secret solution's output to understand what the site is supposed to do.
2. **Write the Utils**: On a new branch, each person should solve one of the
   `/src/utils` functions and write a couple more tests for their solution. When
   you've finished your function send a PR so one of your group members can
   review and merge your code.
3. **Write the Interactions**: On a new branch, each person can write one of the
   user interactions. Be sure to use the shared `numbers` array! When you're
   finished you can send a PR for another group member to review and merge.
